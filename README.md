Save the txt files. Additionally if you want, you can download the PDF files of the company and use the "Pdf to txt" notebook for extraction. Each notebook uses the txt files and has their own code to extract certain sections of the 10-K's. For easier replication, I have provided the cleaned 10-K's for years 2021-2024.
"Final Project.py" contains code for Questions 1 & 2
"Question 3 Code (Cole).py" contains code for Question 3
"Q4_IONQ_PartnershipAnalysis.ipynb" contains code for Question 4
"OpenAI - Final Project.ipynb" contains code for Question 5
"Cleaning - Final Project.ipynb" contains code that cleans the OpenAI extraction and visualizes results
